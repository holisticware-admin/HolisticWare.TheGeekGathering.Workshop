#BINDING OBJECTIVE-C TO C#

#PREQUISITES
-> XCode 5
-> Xamarin studio
-> Objective Sharpie


1. create objective-c static library
	-> http://www.raywenderlich.com/41377/creating-a-status-library-in-ios-tutorial
		
		- TARGETS - YourTargetName - Build Phases - Copy Files
			-> inside this property you need to have your header file (.h)

	-> YOU NEED TO COMBINE STATIC LIB FOR DEVICE AND FOR SIMULATOR (different arch)

2. create Xamarin iOS project (for testing binded library)
	-> Xamarin iOS single view storyboard application
	-> Xamarin iOS binding project (same solution)

3. Objective Sharpie for binding
	-> as of XCode5(iOS7) Apple encourages use of "modules" for framework
	import. 

			#import <UIKit/UIKit.h>
			@import UIKit

	-> For now (07.10.2013) Objective Sharpie doesn't recognize this

	This can be fairly complex process so be sure to read this:
	http://docs.xamarin.com/guides/ios/advanced_topics/binding_objective-c/binding_objc_libs

	http://docs.xamarin.com/guides/ios/advanced_topics/binding_objective-c/binding_walkthrough

	-> If binding is succesfull, save file as *.cs 
		- *.cs file is binded .h file.

	-> normalize *.cs file, more info on the links above.
	-> Objective-C is case sensitive, so method names and property's under
	attribute's must be spelled exactly as in .h file!

4. Select Xamarin binding project and add *.a file (alt + cmd + a)
	-> select copy file

	-> open ApiDefinition.cs 
		- copy binded code (*.cs file from previous step)

5. Select iOS single view project
	-> add iOS binding project as reference
	-> using YourNameSpace

6. Test library :)
